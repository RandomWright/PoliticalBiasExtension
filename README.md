# WiCHacks 2017 Project

Political Bias Chrome Extension

Given the current political climate, we wanted to get a better understanding of how our media sites reflect and influence our views. A recent article by Vox talks about ways to understand and and communicate with people with opposing views by understanding their values. Through our project, we hope to make people aware of their biases, bridge the disconnect between the left and right, and spur more meaningful conversation.
